Quick Summary: If there's one thing you can't say about Peter Thiel it's that he's boring.
Random tidbits on Thiel:
* He is the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir, both multi-billion dollar companies.
* He is the 'Don PayPal Mafia' (a group made of up of the founders and early employees of PayPal, including Elon Musk, among others)
* He made over a billion dollars from his early investment in Facebook
* He wants to live forever. He has invested millions in anti-aging research and will be cryonically preserved when he dies (In case you were wondering, it's a myth that Walt Disney was cryonically preserved. He was cremated like us commoners.)
In Zero to One, Thiel lays out his case for how to think about innovation and startups.

## Takeaways
### Food for thought
Thiel's favorite interview question is: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?". The business version of this question, he says, is "What valuable company is nobody building?"

### Challenge dogma
> "Madness is rare in individuals - but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule," Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.
> You can't escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

### You are not a lottery ticket
> A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
> In 1912, after he became the first explorer to reach the South Pole, Roald Amundsen wrote: "Victory awaits him who has everything in order - luck, people call it." No one pretended that misfortune didn't exist, but prior generations believed in making their own luck by working hard. If you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is worthless if you're just reading stories about people who won the lottery. Slot Machines for Dummies can purport to tell you which kind of rabbit's foot to rub or how to tell which machines are "hot", but it can't tell you how to win.
> If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it.

### Uncover secrets
> Remember our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will––if all of today's conventional ideas are already enlightened, and if everything has already been done––then there are no good answers. Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.
> Anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn't someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique.
> If you think something hard is impossible, you'll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth. The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers.  

### Computers and humans are complements not substitutes
> In 2012, one of Google's supercomputers made headlines when, after scanning 10 million thumbnails of YouTube videos, it learned to identify a cat with 75% accuracy. That seems impressive - until you remember that an average four-year-old can do it flawlessly. When a cheap laptop beats the smartest mathematician at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs can't beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful than each other - they're categorically different. The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people. We don't trade with computers any more than we trade with livestock or lamps. And that's the point: computers are tools, not rivals.
> The most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they'll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?

### Don't compete; monopolize
> Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.
> Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today's margins that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.

### Summary
> Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.
