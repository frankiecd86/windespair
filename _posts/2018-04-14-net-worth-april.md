My Net Worth Is Exactly $42,756.30
It’s tough to talk about money.
In our society, our NET worth is deeply connected to our SELF worth.
The more money you make the more successful, the smarter, the more powerful, the BETTER you are.
Because of this, it can be scary or embarrassing or anxiety-inducing (✋🏽) to talk about money.
So we don’t talk about it.
This is a shame because as a society we are making tons of mistakes when it comes to our personal finances.
Take a look at these depressing statistics:
The average U.S. college graduate begins his or her post-college days with more than $2,000 in credit card debt and the median credit card debt in the U.S. is $3,000. [Wikipedia]
The class of 2015 graduated with $35,051 in student debt on average. [Market Watch]
The savings rate is only 3.4%. This means that for every $1000 we make, we spend spend $966 and save only $34. This is BONKERS.

For this to change we need to talk about money.

We’re not lone wolves — we need help
Money is hard.
How should I invest my money to maximize my earnings?
Should I contribute to my 401(k)?
Am I saving enough for retirement?
Mr. Money Mustache and Jim Collins are two bloggers who have been huge influences on my thinking on personal finance. TK
They helped ease my worries and anxieties and simplified the way I think about money.
I’m glad they ignored the taboo and talked about money.

You don’t need to work until you’re 65
At some point during college I came across Mr. Money Mustache.
Pete Adeney, aka Mr. Money Mustache, is famous for retiring at the age of 30 and blogging about it.
He worked as a software engineer and was able to retire in 10 years through a combination of a high savings rate and investing.
This was mind blowing to me at the time.
I thought that everyone worked until they were 65 unless they got really lucky or had rich parents.
Mr. Money Mustache completely changed how I thought about money and work.

Investing can be simple
Last year I graduated from college and started my first full-time job.
I had about $2,000 saved up from working during college and $30,000 worth of student loans to pay off.
Having this debt hanging over me stressed me out so all of my paychecks for the first few months went towards paying this off.
Once I was debt-free, I had “extra” money each month.
How could I invest this money to maximize my earnings?
Thankfully, after some searching I found Jim Collins’ Stock Series.
Jim Collins retired in 2011 and started his blog as a way to pass on his financial/life knowledge on to his daughter. 
His Stock Series is a collection of 22 posts on everything from investing in index funds, to 401(k)’s, to the mentality one needs to have when in investing.
Thinking about investing and planning for retirement stressed me out.
Jim’s stock series made me realize that investing was simple.
Just like Mr. Money Mustache, he completely changed how I thought about money.
