"I used to think until you're eighteen nothing matters," said Mary.
"That's right," Abe agreed. "And afterward it's the same way."
...
Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to tis kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token...

"Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel––" Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, "––I mean instead of saying a 'cheap' hotel. If any swanky friends asked us our address we'd never say, 'We're in a dingy little hole over in the apache quarter where we're glad of running water,'––we'd say 'We're in a small hotel.' As if the big ones were too noise and vulgar for us."

 "Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe. Anyhow you don't mean that. I can't see why you've given up about everything."
 Abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his nose.
 "I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go back in order to get anywhere."
 Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a helpless child.
 "No excuse for it," Nicole said crisply.
 Abe was feeling worse every minute––he could think of nothing but disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks. Nicole thought that the correct attitude for her was to sit staring ahead, hands in her lap. For a while there was no communication between them––each was racing away from the other, breathing only insofar as there was blue space ahead, a sky not seen by the other. Unlike lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed no future, yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than any one except Dick––and he had been heavy, belly-frightened, with love for her for years.

 Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity––we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.

 "So many smart me go to pieces nowadays."
 "And when haven't they?" Dick asked. "Smart men play close to the line because they have to––some of them can't stand it, so they quit."
 "It must lie deeper than that." Nicole clung to her conversation; also she was irritated that Dick should contradict her before Rosemary. "Artists like––well, like Fernand don't seem to have to wallow in alcohol. Why is it just Americans who dissipate?"
 There were so many answers to this question that Dick decided to leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in Nicole's ears. He had become intensely critical of her. Though he thought she was the most attractive human creature he had ever seen, though he got from her everything he needed, he scented battle from afar, and subconsciously he had been hardening and arming himself, hour by hour. He was not given to self-indulgence and he felt comparatively graceless at this moment of indulging himself, blinding his eyes with the hope that Nicole guess at only an emotional excitement about Rosemary. He was not sure––last night at the theatre she had referred pointedly to Rosemary as a child.

"About eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago or maybe ten––I try to figure but I can't remember exactly where we were when she began to do funny things––crazy things. Her sister was the first one to say anything to me about it––because Nicole was always the same to me," he added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being to blame, "––the same loving little girl. The first thing was about a valet."
"Oh, yes," said Doctor Dohmler, nodding his venerable head, as if, like Sherlock Holmes, he had expected a valet and and only a valet to be introduced at this point.

"I thought it was. I can see how she'd be very attractive to men."
His heart twisted. To what men? How many men?

They were both restless in the night. In a day or two Dick would try to banish the ghost of Rosemary before it became walled up with them, but for the moment he had no force to do it. Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the moment there was nothing to do but pretend.

One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.

It would be hundreds of years before any emergent Amazons would ever grasp the fact that a man is vulnerable only in his pride, but delicate as Humpty-Dumpty once that is meddled with––though some of them paid the fact a cautious lip-service.

Being alone in body and spirit begets loneliness, and loneliness begets more loneliness.

As if a drink were acting on him, warming the lining of his stomach, throwing a flush up into his brain, he saw the person he had come to see, the person for whom he had made the Mediterranean crossing.

Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people's lives. Yet from this fog his affection emerged––the best contacts are when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation.

Kaethe admitted to herself that she had been too hard on Dick, whom she admired of whome she stood in awe, who had been so appreciative and understanding of herself. As for Franz, once Kaethe's idea had had time to sink in, he never after believed that Dick was a serious person. And as time went on he convinced himself that he had never thought so.

So, for the shoddiness of needs, are shoes made out of last year's hide.

There was little they dared talk about in these days; seldom did they find the right word when it counted, it arrived always a moment too late when one could not reach the other any more.

It was as though an incalculable story was telling itself inside him, about which she could only guess at in the moments when it broke through the surface.

Either you think––or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.
