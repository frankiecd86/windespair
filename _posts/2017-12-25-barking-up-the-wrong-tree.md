## Do less
> We all have only twenty-four hours in a day. If we use an hour for this, we're not using it for that. But we act like there are no limits... We can't do it all and do it well.

### Small changes big results
> Shawn Achor recommends the "twenty second rule". Make the things you should do twenty seconds easier to start and make the things you shouldn't be doing twenty seconds harder... Ariely told me of a simple study done at Google's New York office. Instead of putting M&M's out in the open, they put them in containers. What was the result? People ate three million fewer of them in a single month.

### Who you choose to be
> In Kurt Vonnegut's classic novel Mother Night, Howard W. Campbell Jr. is an American spy who poses as a Nazi propagandist during World War II. He becomes the "voice" of Nazi Germany on radio programs, ostensibly singing the praises of the Reich while in fact transmitting coded messages back to the United States. While his intentions are good, he comes to realize that his "fake" Nazi inspirational messages have more effect on motivating the enemy than his secret intelligence efforts do in assisting the allies.Vonnegut's moral is that "We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."

> Dan Ariely did a study in which people were given the opportunity to cheat on a test. (They didn't know the researchers administering the test would be able to tell.) Of course, those who exploited this performed better, but here's what's interesting when surveyed about how they thought they'd do on another test, the cheaters rated themselves higher than non-cheaters... This is like pretending to fly a plane while in reality someone else is manning the controls, and the next time you walk into a cockpit believing you're actually a good pilot. As Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote, "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true."

### Elevators
> Those mirrored elevator lobbies? That's not elegant design. Those mirrors are there because when we can stare at ourselves we pay less attention to how long the wait time is and complaints drop.

> The designers call it "door dwell"——how long before the doors close. it's usually under four seconds. Doesn't matter. Not fast enough. What's consistently the button that gets hit so much that the paint is wearing off? Gleick confirms it's DOOR CLOSE.
