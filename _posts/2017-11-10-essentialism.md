A curious case of deja vu swept over me as I read this book. 

### Reject empty words
> The actor/social entrepreneur Brad Pitt, appalled by the lack of progress in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, started an organization called "Make It Right" with the essential intent "to build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families living in the Lower 9th Ward." The statement took the air out of the room. The concreteness of the objective made it real. The realness made it inspiring. It answered the question: "How will we know when we have succeeded?"

### If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging
> Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped. But of course this can easily become a vicious cycle: the more we invest, the more determined we become to see it through and see our investment pay off. The more we invest in something, the harder it is to let go.
> A sense of ownership is a powerful thing. As the saying goes, nobody in the history of the world has washed their rental car! This is because of something called "the endowment effect," our tendency to undervalue things that aren't ours and to overvalue things because we already own them.

What are you thinking of right now? What popped in your head as you read about sunk-cost bias and the endowment effect? When I read this some projects I've been meaning to work on reared their heads. Truth is I don't find them that interesting or worthwhile, but I've already spent time on them so not finishing them at this point would mean I wasted x many hours.

### One step at a time
> Take a goal or a deadline you have coming up and ask yourself, "What is the minimal amount I could do right now to prepare?"
> Do you remember when you were five years old and your school held a fund-raiser? Remember the big thermometer that visually showed the progress the school was making toward the goal? Can you remember how exciting and motivating it was to watch the level of the thermometer go up each day? There is something powerful about visibly seeing progress toward a goal. Don't be above applying the same technique to your own essential goals, at home or at work.

### Do more by doing less; cut out the unimportant
> The overwhelming reality is: we live in a world where almost everything is worthless and very few things are exceptionally valuable. As John Maxwell has written, "You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything."

### Summary
> Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done. It doesn't mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.
