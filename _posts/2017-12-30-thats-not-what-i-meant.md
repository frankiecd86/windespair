### The closeness-independence paradox
> The philosopher Schopenhauer gave an often-quoted example of porcupines trying to get through a cold winter. They huddle together for warmth, but their sharp quills prick each other, so they pull away. But then they get cold. They have to keep adjusting their closeness and distance to keep from freezing and from getting pricked by their fellow porcupines——the source of both comfort and pain.

### Actions and reactions
> At any point, each person is both reacting to and causing a reaction in others. Most of us tend to see ourselves as responding to what others say, without realizing that what they are saying may be a reaction to us. We are keenly aware that we said what we did because of what she said, but it may not occur to us that she said what she did because of what we said——just before, yesterday, or last year.

> We tend to see our own behavior as a reaction to others; if we are rude to someone who has annoyed or offended us, we do not think this rudeness defines our personality; we think we were rude in that instance. But we think of others' personality as absolute. If others are rude to use, we are likely to conclude that they are rude people, not that they are nice people who were rude in that instance——possibly in response to something we said or did.

> The important thing is to know that what seem like bad intentions may really be good intentions expressed in a different conversational style. We have to give up our conviction that, as Robin Lakoff put it, "Love means never having to say 'What do you mean?'."

> Gregory Bateson pointed out that people often fail to distinguish between the map and the territory: the real thing and the thing that represents it symbolically. If we identify strongly with out home, our clothing, our partners, or the restaurant we chose, then criticism aimed at them feels like criticism of us. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it isn't. It's important to remember that the map is not the territory: Some people freely aim arrows at external objects with which people identify, yet they have no intention of wounding people.

> Secondhand criticism is in many ways more destructive than hearing the same criticism from its source. criticism spoken directly carries a metamessage of involvement: caring enough to tell. It invites an explanation or self-justification, and the ensuing confrontation is likely to end with a display of renewed solidarity and good will. In contrast, any criticism heard secondhand sounds worse than it would face to face. Words spoken out of our presence strike us as more powerful, just as people we know only by reputation seem larger than life. It is as if by virtue of being overheard, a message is guaranteed to be the truth——what others really feel but would not say to us.

> Hearing someone repeat something said about you in your absence puts you in the position, for a fleeting moment, of an eavesdropper on a conversation you weren't supposed to hear, with the added complication that what you hear is necessarily incomplete, out of context, and subject to the alterations that are inevitable when information is filtered through human imagination.

> Wrenching an aspect of the truth from one context and hauling it to another alters its effect and is likely to misrepresent the intentions of the original speaker.
