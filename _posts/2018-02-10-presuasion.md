To persuade optimally, then, it's necessary to pre-suade optimally. But how? In part, the answer involves an essential but poorly appreciated tenet of all communication: what we present first changes the way people experience what we present to them next.

Zeigarnik effect
She never lets herself finish a writing session at the end of a paragraph or even a thought. She assured me she knows precisely what she wants to say at the end of that last pargraph or thought; she just doesn't allow herself to say it until the next time. By keeping the final feature of every writing session near-finished, she uses the motivating force of the drive for closure to get her back to the chair quickly impatient to write again.

A little-recognized truth I often try to convey to various audiences is that, in contests of persuasion, counterarguments are typically more powerful than arguments. This superiority emerges especially when a counterclaim does more than refute a rival's claim by showing it to be mistaken or misdirected in the particular instance, but does so instead by showing the rival communicator to be an untrustworthy source of information, generally. Issuing a counterargument demonstrating that an opponent's argument is not to be believed because its maker is misinformed on the topic will usually succeed on that single issue. But a counterargument that undermines an opponent's argument by showing him or her to be dishonest in the matter will normally win that battle plus future battles with the opponent.

Mystery provokes intrigue
1. Pose the mystery
2. Deepen the mystery
3. Home in on the proper explanation by considering (and offering evidence against) alternative explanations
4. Provide a clue to the proper explanation
5. Resolve the mystery
6. Draw the implication for the phenomenon under study

Associations
We convince others by using language that manages their mental **associations** to our message. Their thoughts, perceptions, and emotional reactions merely proceed from those associations.
SSM Health
"As a health care organization, we're devoted to acts of healing, so we never use language associated with violence. We don't have **bullet** points; we have information points. We don't **attack** a problem, we approach it." "We've replaced business **targets** with business goals. And one of those goals is no longer to **beat** our competition; it's to outdistance or out pace them."

To make it climb, make it rhyme
Poetry possessing rhyme and regular meter evokes something more than greater favor from readers; it also evokes perceptions of higher aesthetic value... The statement "Caution and measure will win you riches" is seen as more true when changed to "Caution and measure will win you treasure."

Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky tips for increasing personal happiness.
1. Count your blessings and gratitudes at the start of every day, and then give yourself concentrated time with them by writing them down.
2. Cultivate optimism by choosing beforehand to look on the bright side of situations, events, and future possibilities.
3. Negate the negative by deliberately limiting time spent dwelling on problems or on unhealthy comparisons with others. (Tuesdays with Morrie?)

Alan told me that just prior to taking any standardized exam, he'd spend systematic time "getting psyched up" for it... He knew, he said, that focusing on material that was still vexing him would only elevate his anxieties. Instead, he spent that crucial time consciously calming his fears and simultaneously building his confidence by reviewing his past academic successes and enumerating his genuine strengths... "You can't think straight when you're scared," he reminded me, "plus, you're much more persistent when you're confident in your abilities."

Similarities and compliments cause people to feel that you like **them**, and once they come to recognize that you like them, they'll want to do business with you. That's because people trust that those who like them will try to steer them correctly.

After people read a happy story, their temporarily elevated mood caused them to like a painting. But five days later, only those who had actively rated it while in that elated state still felt the same way about that painting. Those who had not rated it––and, therefore, had not "locked in" that evaluation behaviorally––showed no special preference for it at all after the happy mood had dissipated... Pre-suasive openers can produce dramatic, immediate shifts in people, but to turn those shifts into durable changes, it's necessary to get commitments to them, usually in the form of related behavior.

Whether we are wary of the underlying process, attracted to its potential, or both, we'd be right to acknowledge its considerable power and wise to understand its inner workings.

The notion of a ripe period of time (when action is called for) is even older, represented in the ancient Greek word **kairos** and the concept of the "**kairos** moment" that refers to an instant when time and circumstance converge auspiciously. Indeed, no less a teacher in the arts of influence than Aristotle advised orators of the importance of seizing the right moment when presenting an argument.

Reciprocation ((meaningful, unexpected, customized))
Customization
Consider as evidence what happened in a fast-food restaurant where visitors were greeted as they entered and given one of two equally priced gifts. If the gift was not food related (a key chain), the amount they then spent increased by 12 percent compared with visitors who were greeted without being given a gift. But if the gift was food related (a cup of yogurt), their increased outlay climbed to 24 percent. (Friedman and Rahman 2011)

Meaningful + unexpected
Some diners in a New Jersey restaurant were offered a piece of chocolate at the end of their meals, one per person, from a basket carried to the table by the waitress. Her tips went up 3.3 percent compared with those from guests who weren't offered chocolates. However, when other diners were invited to take two chocolates from the basket, the waitress's tips rose by 14 percent. The second chocolate represented a meaningful increase in the size of a gift––a doubling. After offering guests one chocolate from her basket and turning to walk away. she unexpectedly returned to the table and offered a second chocolate to each diner. As a result, her average tip improved by 21.3 percent. (Strohmetz 2002)
