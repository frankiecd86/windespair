I learned about *Steven Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From* from a James Altucher [book recommendation list](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/09/books-brain-expand/) (I'm currently working my way through the rest of the books on this list). This book talks about the origins of good ideas, the environment necessary to cultivate them, and the way they develop through connection and reinvention. Johnson seamlessly combines theory, history, and various anecdotes. I've listed my takeaways from the book below, including some excerpts I especially liked.

### The Adjacent Possible
Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist, coined the term "the adjacent possible"; he wrote "Autonomous agents forever push their way into noveltyâ€” molecular, morphological, behavioral, organizational. I will formalize this push into novelty as the mathematical concept of an 'adjacent possible.'"

As Johnson puts it:
> The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself. Yet it is not an infinite space, or a totally open playing field. What the adjacent possible tells us is that at any moment the world is capable of extraordinary change, but only *certain* changes can happen. The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore those boundaries.

 Johnson applies Kauffman's original concept to the world of ideas. Great ideas don't occur in isolation, rather they use previous ideas as springboards to expand the previous limits of the adjacent possible.

### Liquid Networks
Johnson says good ideas are networks, referencing the underlying network of neurons in our brains, and emphasizes two key points about our neural networks: their massive size and their plasticity.
> You can't have an epiphany with only three neurons firing. The network needs to be densely populated. Your brain has roughly 100 billion neurons, an impressive number, but all those neurons would be useless for creating ideas (as well as all the other achievements of the human brain) if they weren't capable of making such elaborate connections with each other.  
A dense network incapable of forming new patterns is, by definition, incapable of change, incapable of probing at the edges of the adjacent possible. When a new idea pops into your head, the sense of novelty that makes the experience so magical has a direct correlate in the cells of your brain: a brand-new assemblage of neurons has come together to make the thought possible.

So how do we maximize the power of our networks?
> To make your mind more innovative, you have to place it inside environment that share that same network signature: networks of ideas or people that mimic the neural networks of a mind exploring the boundaries of the adjacent possible.
