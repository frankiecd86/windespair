Once a month I share my net worth.

**Related:** [Net Worth Update #6 - September 2018](/net-worth-september-2018)

I do this as it's motivational to see the progress other bloggers are making on their financial goals and, hopefully, to provide some motivation for others as well.

I shared my first net worth update back in [April 2018](/net-worth-april-2018) and have been sharing monthly updates since.

Here are my numbers for October 2018:

## Progress
Hereâ€™s a look at my net worth progression since I started tracking it back in December of 2017:

## Recap
From September to October my net worth increased by only $2,074 even though I invested around $7,000. That's about a 2% increase from last month, the lowest, and first non double-digit growth month, since I started tracking my net worth in December of 2017.

The culprit for this poor month was the topsy-turvy market. It did not do well this month and since 90% of my money is invested in stock index funds, I took the hit as well. Here's how VTSAX fared in October:

While slightly disappointing, months like these are a great opportunity to buy low and toughen up emotionally. Investing is a long-term game and as long as I continue to consistently save and invest, I'll do well in the end. The important thing is to focus on what we can control and not let the state of the market affect our strategy. The two big areas in my control are how much I make and how much I save. If I take care of these two areas, all else will take care of itself.

One thing I'll be doing going forward is holding as little money as possible in my checking account. Over the past few months I've been holding around $2,000 in my checking account as an extra safety buffer, but since I have a few month's savings in my savings account, I think this is overkill. I'll either invest this money or hold it in my savings account to at least earn some interest.

## Where Did My Money Go?

This month I made another investment in VTSAX. I invested $5,524 as a lump sum on the 31st at $68.29 per share.

Unfortunately, I missed the dip in the market. VTSAX shares fell as low as $65.68 on the 29th, but by the time I bought they'd made a resurgence. It turns out I bought at the peak as shares have since gone down to $67.93. This is me venting more than anything else as these small fluctuations are inconsequential in the long term.

I also put in $1,738 into my 401k and I've now almost reached the $18,500 max annual contribution limit. I have about $1,100 to go which I'll add in November.

## Where I'm Headed

Overall, the game plan remains unchanged: save as much as possible, max out my 401k, and put all I can into VTSAX. The goal is to surpass the $100k mark sometime before the end of 2018 (ðŸ¤ž). This is looking slightly more difficult now with the current state of the market, but I'm holding out hope.
