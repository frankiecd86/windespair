title: How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big
---

I recently read Scott Adams' book How to . Scott has recently risen to fame. I thought it was a great read. I've listed some of my takeaways from the book below, including some passages I especially liked.

### Systems over goals
> System is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. For our purposes, let’s agree that goals are a reach-it-and-be-done situation, whereas a system is something you do on a regular basis with a reasonable expectation that doing so will get you to a better place in your life. Systems have no deadlines, and on any given day you probably can’t tell if they’re moving you in the right direction.
> In the long run, any system that depends on your willpower will fail.

### It's okay to be selfish

### Personal energy needs to be high
> It’s smarter to see your big-idea projects as part of a system to improve your energy, contacts, and skills. From that viewpoint, if you have a big, interesting project in the works, you’re a winner every time you wake up.

### Sum of skills
* Public speaking
* Psychology
* Business writing
* Accounting
* Design (the basics)
* Conversation
* Overcoming shyness
* Second language
* Golf
* Proper grammar
* Persuasion
* Technology (hobby level)
* Proper voice technique

### Simplifier vs optimizer
Wife vs him

### Affirmations
> Another possible reason that affirmations appear to work is that optimists tend to notice opportunities that pessimists miss. A person who diligently writes affirmations day after day is the very definition of an optimist, even if only by actions. Any form of positive thinking, prayer, or the like, would presumably put a person in a more optimistic mind-set. And because optimists have been shown in studies to notice more opportunities than pessimists, the result can look like luck. Studies show that you need not be a natural-born optimist to get the benefits of better perception. You can train yourself to act like an optimist—and writing affirmations is probably good training—so that you get the same benefits as natural optimists when it comes to noticing opportunities.

### Summary
* Be happy
* Eat right.
* Exercise.
* Get enough sleep.
* Imagine an incredible future (even if you don’t believe it).
* Work toward a flexible schedule.
* Do things you can steadily improve at.
* Help others (if you’ve already helped yourself).
* Reduce daily decisions to routine
* The main point for both diet and exercise is that you want to reduce the amount of willpower required. Any other approach is unsustainable.

> “It might help some of you to think of yourself as moist robots and not skin bags full of magic and mystery. If you control the inputs, you can determine the outcomes, give or take some luck.”
