The title comes from a Steve Martin quote... and that is what this book is about.
Steve Martin's answer to Charlie Rose's question of his advice for aspiring performers: "Be so good that they can't ignore you"


### Follow your passion is bad advice
> Whereas the **craftsman mindset** focuses on what you can offer the world, the **passion mindset** focuses instead on what the world can offer you... When you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it, leading to chronic unhappiness... more serious, the deep questions driving the passion mindset——"Who am I?" and "What do I truly love?"—— are essentially impossible to confirm. "Is this who I really am?" and "Do I love this?" rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused.

### Key to mastery #1: Deliberate practice
> Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable. I like the term "stretch" for describing what deliberate practice feels like, as it matches my own experience with the activity. When I'm learning a new mathematical technique——a classic case of deliberate practice——the uncomfortable sensation in my head is best approximated as a physical strain, as if my neurons are physically re-forming into new configurations. As any mathematician will admit, this stretching feels much different than applying a technique you've already mastered, which can be quite enjoyable. But this stretching, as any mathematician will also admit, is the precondition to getting better.

### Key to mastery #2: Hard work
> "All of us who do creative work... you get into this thing, and there's like a 'gap.' What you're making isn't so good, okay?... It's trying to be good but... it's just not that great," he explained in an interview about his career. "The key thing is to force yourself through the hard work, force the skills to come; that's the hardest phase," he elaborated in his Roadtrip Nation session.

### Key to mastery #3: Patience
> In his 2007 interview with Charlie Rose, here's how Steve Martin explained his strategy for learning the banjo: "[I thought], if I stay with it, then one day I will have been playing for forty years, and anyone who sticks with something for forty years will be pretty good at it."

### Key to mastery #4: Feedback
> "You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals," he told me. "When I look back now, I'm humiliated that I ever showed it to anyone," Alex recalled. But it was necessary if he was going to get better. "I hope I can look back ten years later and say the same about what I'm writing now."

### Little bets
> To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. These bets allow you to tentatively explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results.

### The Law of Financial Viability
> "I have this principle about money that overrides my other life rules," he said. "**Do what people are willing to pay for.**" As he explained, "Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable."

Not about pursuing money for the sake of having money and hobbies are exempt from this rule.
