I just finished reading Don Miguel Ruiz's *The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book)*. Don Miguel Ruiz was raised in rural Mexico by his healer mother and his shaman grandfather. He became a surgeon, but after a car accident that nearly cost him his life, Ruiz returned home to learn from his mother. He then completed an apprenticeship under a shaman in the Mexican desert and moved to the United States. Ruiz says he is from the [Eagle-Knight lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_warrior){:target="_blank"} and that The Four Agreements are based on ancient [Toltec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec){:target="_blank"} wisdom.

Reading Ruiz's biography on the book's inner flap rang some alarm bells as talk of healers, shamans, desert apprenticeships, Eagle-Knight lineage, and ancient Toltec wisdom tends to do. Reading online about Toltec culture, however, revealed that scholars/historians see the Toltecs "as largely a mythical and philosophical construct by either the Aztecs or Mesoamericans generally that served to symbolize the might and sophistication of several civilizations during the Mesoamerican Postclassic period. Furthermore, among the Nahuan peoples the word "Tolteca" was synonymous with artist, artisan or wise man, and "toltecayotl... This interpretation argues that any large urban center in Mesoamerica could be referred to as "Tollan" and its inhabitants as Toltecs â€“ and that it was common practice among ruling lineages in Postclassic Mesoamerica to strengthen claims to power by claiming Toltec ancestry." [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec#Toltecs_as_myth){:target="_blank"}]

While some elements of the book, such as Ruiz's lineage, may be hard to believe, it's worth putting aside disbelief and reading this book. It is fairly short (138 pages with the last 7 pages consisting of prayers), but it rambles on quite a bit (the book could easily be condensed into half its length). I've listed some of my takeaways from the book below, including some excerpts I especially liked.

### We are domesticated animals
Ruiz coins the term "**dream of the planet**", which he describes as:
> The collective dream of billions of smaller, personal dreams, which together create a dream of a family, a dream of a community, a dream of a city, a dream of a country, and finally a dream of the whole humanity.

> As children, we didn't have the opportunity to choose our beliefs, but we agreed with the information that was passed to us from the **dream of the planet** via other humans. We didn't choose these beliefs and we may have rebelled against them, but we were not strong enough to win the rebellion. The result is surrender to the beliefs with our agreement. I call this process **the domestication of humans**.

Most of the things we believe were passed on to us from parents, teachers, priests, friends, etc. We never challenge these beliefs (for example, a friend calling us ugly or a teacher calling us stupid) and they cloud our mind and prevent us from seeing things as they really are.

### The First Agreement: Be Impeccable With Your Word
> Whenever we hear an opinion and believe it, we make an agreement, and it becomes part of our belief system.

> When you are impeccable, you take responsibility for your actions, but you do not judge or blame yourself.

> Looking at everyday human interactions, imagine how many times we cast spells on each other with our word. Over time this interaction has become the worst form of black magic, and we call it gossip.

Don't underestimate the power of our words. We have the power to ruin someone's day or to lower someone's self-esteem. Why not use that power to be kind and show our love and appreciation?

### The Second Agreement: Don't Take Anything Personally
> Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves. All people live in their own dream, in their own mind; they are in a completely different world from the one we live in. When we take something personally, we make the assumption that they know that is in our world, and we try to impose our world on their world.

> You create an entire picture or movie in your mind, and in that picture you are the director, you are the producer, you are the main actor or actress. everyone else is a secondary actor or actress. It is your movie. The way that you see that movie is according to the agreements you have made with life. Your point of view is something personal to you. It's no one's truth but yours.

This really hit home for me. Not only is it something that I find myself doing often, but this idea reminded me of other things I've previously read. The idea that we are the center of our universes is perfectly stated by David Foster Wallace in his 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College [[audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI){:target="_blank"}] [[transcript](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf){:target="_blank"}]. Scott Adams [[takeaways from his book here](https://www.windespair.com/scott-adams-how-to-win-big/){:target="_blank"}] often talks about how everyone sees the same event, yet comes to wildly different conclusions based on our beliefs and our "agreements" [[article from Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/157149611381/good-example-of-our-two-movie-reality){:target="_blank"}]. Finally, it reminds me of the [parable of the Chinese farmer](https://sivers.org/horses){:target="_blank"} which eloquently states how difficult it is to accurately analyze the events currently happening in our life, both good and bad, without the benefit of hindsight.

### The Third Agreement: Don't Make Assumptions
>

This agreement is strongly related to the previous one. If you haven't done so, please watch David Foster Wallace's commencement speech linked above as it speaks to these two agreements; few people in this world have or have had Wallace's tremendous ability with words, both written and spoken.
