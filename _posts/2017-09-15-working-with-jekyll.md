* [WinDespair](https://www.WinDespair.com): The site you are currently on. It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The base theme for this site is WebJeda's [Thunder](http://webjeda.com/thunder/) theme. I drew design inspiration from Jacob Kaplan Moss' [terrific site](https://jacobian.org/) and from the site of Jekyll-guru [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). Comment functionality is provided by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Source code is [here](https://github.com/GonzaloZiadi/windespair/).
