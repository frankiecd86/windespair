* [WinDespair](https://www.WinDespair.com): The site you are currently on. It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and hosted for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"}. The base theme for this site is WebJeda's [Thunder](http://webjeda.com/thunder/){:target="_blank"} theme. I drew design inspiration from Jacob Kaplan Moss' [terrific site](https://jacobian.org/){:target="_blank"} and from the site of Jekyll-guru [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/){:target="_blank"}. Comment functionality is provided by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/){:target="_blank"}. Source code is [here](https://github.com/GonzaloZiadi/windespair/){:target="_blank"}.
