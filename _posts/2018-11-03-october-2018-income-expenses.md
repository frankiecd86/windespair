At the end of each month, I provide a summary of all the income I earned as well as all the expenses I incurred.

**Related:** [Net Worth Update #6 - October 2018](/net-worth-october-2018)

I share this to provide real numbers behind my financial journey. Financial independence, and the road leading to it, can be a hazy concept without actual numbers. Hopefully, seeing this helps bridge the gap between financial independence as an idea and financial independence as a reality, for others and for myself as well.

## Income

### October Savings Rate: 67%

### Recap
I say this every year, but it's hard to believe we're already in November. Thanksgiving is around the corner and Christmas is not far behind. One day you're laying on the couch, napping after too much mashed potatoes and turkey, stretching your sweatpants to the fullest, and next thing you know a fat bearded guy is trying to break into your house through the chimney. It's truly the best time of the year.

Expenses this month were still higher than usual as I'm covering rent and groceries for two since Sammy is still settling into her new job and her paychecks are just starting to trickle in. We also finally got Toothless (our black Ford Fiesta) registered in Washington and I booked a flight to visit my parents in Florida for Christmas, each adding a hefty one-off expense.

I'll admit I was worried about increased spending when Sammy and I moved in together at the start of September, but we're pretty well aligned as far as our views on money go (though I tend to be more extreme...) and my spending habits haven't really changed since we've moved in together. We meal prep together for the week on Saturdays and both like to hike and spend time outdoors, which doesn't cost much outside of gas and an annual entrance pass (and some tolls after a few wrong turns...)

This month I once again had some side-hustle money courtesy of Medium. I've talked about Medium in the past few income & expense reports ([July](/july-2018-income-expenses) and [August](/august-2018-income-expenses)), so I won't repeat myself here.

The bulk of the $362 came from one [story](https://medium.com/swlh/stop-trying-to-memorize-a-good-book-will-change-you-2bebafb22203) which went "viral" (over 3,800 "likes") a few months back. This post netted me $351.30 this month, about 57% of the total.

My income from Medium for the past four months has been fairly variable: $248.38 in July, $847.47 in August, $687.37 in September, and $362 in October. The income has been steadily decreasing since the peak in August as I haven't been posting too often.

As time passes without fresh stories, I fade from Medium's discovery algorithms and my previous posts get less and less views. The idea is to get back to a consistent posting schedule over the next few months and try and get the monthly side-hustle income back over $500.

I wrote these posts in the first half of the year and so they've been receiving less and less views as time passes. Still, it's cool to continue to receive "royalties" for posts I wrote months back.

### Where I'm Headed
October was another great month. I'm writing every day early in the morning and making headway at my full-time job as a software engineer.

The steadily decreasing side-hustle income courtesy of Medium is unfortunate, but this is an area I plan to focus on over the next few months. Having a steady side-hustle that I enjoy working on and provides some extra income continues to be a big goal of mine.

I'll probably still be covering some extra expenses in November as Sammy finishes settling into her job and pads her savings a bit, but I should be back over a 70% savings rate in December, at the latest.

Thanks for reading and I'll see you in the next update.
