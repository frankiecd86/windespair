My girlfriend gifted me *The Giver* by Lois Lowry about a year back and I finally read it (better late than never). *The Giver* is the epitome of the Young Adult genre: a young protagonist has his life instantly and surprisingly changed by a Big Event and is now unable to connect with others due to the enormity of his current predicament. Still, it's entertaining and offered me the chance to think through some philosophical (?) questions I hadn't thought of.
