My girlfriend gifted me *The Giver* by Lois Lowry about a year back and I finally read it (better late than never). *The Giver* is the epitome of the Young Adult genre: a young protagonist whose life is instantly and surprisingly changed by a big event, now unable to connect with others due to the enormity and gravity of his current predicament. Still, it's entertaining and offered me the chance to think through some philosophical (?) questions I hadn't thought of.
