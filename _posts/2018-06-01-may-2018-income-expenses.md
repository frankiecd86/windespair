At the end of each month, I provide a summary of all the income I earned working at my 9-5 as a software engineer as well as all the expenses I incurred.

I share this to provide real numbers behind my financial journey. Financial independence, and the road leading to it, can be a hazy concept without actual numbers. Hopefully seeing this helps bridge the gap between financial independence as an idea and financial independence as a reality, for others and for myself as well.

## Income
Here's what my post-tax income looked like in May:

## May Savings Rate: 80%

### Recap
May was a fairly normal month.

I went to California this month to visit a friend and I bought a ticket to go visit my parents later in the year.

The Golden Gate Bridge and the surrounding bay was an incredible sight:

Even with the traveling, my savings rate remained in my 75-80% goal range. Life is good :)

### Where I'm Headed
My full-time job as a software engineer is going really well. I've learned more in the past few months than I did during whole years during college.

One thing I'm looking into is creating additional income streams. What these will end up being I am not sure right now, but I am planting the seeds in my subconscious so that I am on the lookout üòÅ Maybe down the road this blog will serve as an income stream through ad revenue or the Amazon affiliate program.

Meanwhile, the goal is to continue saving 75-80% of my income. I'll be doing some traveling later in the year so I'll probably miss the mark during a month or two, but the trips will be worth it ‚úàÔ∏è

Finally, a shout out to Zach over at [Four Pillar Freedom](www.fourpillarfreedom.com) for inspiring this Income & Expenses series.
