What I'm currently working on:
* Getting better at software engineering (my full-time job)
* Writing. In February I started posting 3 times a week over at [Medium](https://medium.com/@GZiadi).
* Reading. Working my way through *A Series of Unfortunate Events* (it's still as great as when I first read it in middle school). You can find all I'm reading [here](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/collection/show/1045230707/library/completed). Shout out to the Seattle public library system!
