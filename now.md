Currently in Boston (Somerville) visiting my girlfriend. Beautiful city. We walked the Freedom Trail and spent some terrific afternoons in the Boston Common/Public Garden. Moving to Seattle in early August to begin working at Amazon. First job out of college; nervous and excited. Lately, I've been working on this blog. Tinkering with how it looks and adding commenting functionality. Now just need to work on the content üòÅ. I should be kept busy the next few months by moving/adjusting to Seattle, work, this blog, and hopefully my first iOS app release.
