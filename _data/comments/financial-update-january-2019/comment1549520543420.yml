message: "Sorry to hear about the accident and happy to hear you're both safe & well! Thank you for the effort with the blog, I found it right when I needed it and although my income isn't quite as high as yours, I'm setting my financial goals to emulate yours.\r\n\r\nI have one question.. I have recently opened a Vanguard Roth IRA and maxed my 2018 contribution, investing it all into VTSAX and set up automatic deposits to take care of the 2019 contributions. I do however have a decent chunk leftover that I'd like to invest into VTSAX too, and I'm wondering what you think the best course of action is? Your screenshot looks as though it's taken from Robinhood.. Are you purchasing the ETF?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nDave"
