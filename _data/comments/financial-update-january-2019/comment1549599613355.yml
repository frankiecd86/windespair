message: "I appreciate it Dave!\r\n\r\nThe screenshot is from Google –– it's the automatic chart that pops up if you search for VTSAX.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried Robinhood. Since I only invest in VTSAX (mutual fund version), I just do it through the Vanguard website.\r\n\r\nThe 2 reasons I use the mutual fund version are:\r\n1. I just buy and hold. It's easier to trade with the ETF since you can buy/sell them at any time of the day versus once at the end of the day for the mutual fund. However, this also adds some complexity for ETFs since now you have to worry about bid/ask prices, timing, etc.\r\n2. You can buy fractional shares of a mutual fund, but not an ETF. When I invest $100, the whole $100 get invested with no leftover amount. \r\n\r\nAn extra point to consider since you mention automatic deposits is that automated investments are only possible with the mutual fund. This is not something I currently use, but it's nice to have it there in case I ever do.\r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme, I don't think you'll go wrong with either mutual fund or ETF for VTSAX as they're basically the same.\r\n\r\nLet me know if that answered what you were asking or if I just rambled."
