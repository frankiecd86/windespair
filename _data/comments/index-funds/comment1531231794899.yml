  if anybody is going down the individual stock rabbit hole they would be wise
  to diversify and own at least 15 names.  don't mess around with positions
  under a thousand bucks because buying and selling them has a fee of a few
  bucks per trade.  it takes some patience but getting cute hasn't worked well
  for me.  i bought a motley food stock adviser subscription (they're not paying
  me.  i just like them) and they helped me identify winners.  they also have a
  good free education section if you can get past the promotional junk.  free
  financial education = good to me.
