message: "I've been on Robinhood for a month and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nhttps://share.robinhood.com/robertm7186\r\n\r\nIf you use my link above, we each receive a free stock!  And, I'm giving you just a bit of advice if you are brand-new to the stock market, like I was.\r\n\r\nMy first free stock was Zynga, worth about $4.  Knowing nothing about stocks, I just searched on Robinhood and found around a hundred stocks that had a value of under $1, many with values around 15 to 40 cents.\r\n\r\nSo, I set a hard limit on how much I would transfer to Robinhood... $20.  With my Zynga stock I was already up to $24!  I did a bit of youtube watching and some educated guessing and bought a bunch of \"penny stocks\" -those are the super-cheap stocks.\r\n\r\nI watched them over the first week and learned how to buy and sell using the limit/stop limit/stop loss order types.  I gained and lost over the first week, but... I never lost more than $4 total, so my $20 investment was preserved.  I had learned and gained a bit!\r\n\r\nSo, I gathered up loose change around the house and in my car and took it to the bank... around $39.  I transferred that in and then moved up to stocks that were around $3 to $7.  Again, I lost some, and gained some due to judgement errors, but I was using \"found\" money, basically.  My goal has been to simply build that amount without putting in more.\r\n\r\nI think if you set a \"limit\" when you begin as to how much you will put in to your account, then this can be enjoyable and a very low-cost learning experience that may allow you to continue trading and earning small amounts, as I am.\r\n\r\nIf this was helpful, please use my referral code!  Thanks!"
