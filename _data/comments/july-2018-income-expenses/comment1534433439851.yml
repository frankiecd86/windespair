message: "I love seeing that side hustle income. \r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised at how much I made off of Medium last month. I didn't have anything as successful as your article, but I did have my most successful article yet (101 people clapped over 1k times). That netted me over $65 and then the other locked stories I posted combined for another $85 or so for a total of $149 and change which I promptly put in my IRA. \r\n\r\nIt's a weird thing though because I don't like losing the call to action that comes when you monetize a post. This month I'm going heavy on locked posts as an experiment to see what happens, but I'm not sure how I'll handle the balance between locked vs. posts with a CTA in the long-term.\r\n\r\nAt least the locked posts still have the potential to build your follower base on Medium. \r\n\r\nAnyway, looks like you're killing it on all fronts, savings rate, earning money, keeping expenses low. That $17 utility bill is sweeeeeet."
