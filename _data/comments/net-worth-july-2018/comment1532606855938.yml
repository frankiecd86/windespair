message: "Revisiting to for additional comments.  Let me just say that you are far beyond any place your peers are in terms of financial health.  So congratulations are in order, I am very impressed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, your net worth is amazing.  At your age, I was nowhere near your mindset.  That said, let's dive in to your numbers...\r\n\r\n1. It won't have for a few decades , as I found, but your contributions is really what is going to make up your gains for a long time.  But don't take your foot off that peddle!\r\n\r\n2. Wise decision to move your savings into a higher earning interest account.  I have also found that Wells is a bit stingy on their interest rates.\r\n\r\nBest part of your Net Worth, \"The goal is to maintain my high savings rate...\".  You can earn, which means you have a choice - spend or save & invest.  You chose the later.  With this discipline, I would fully expect you to be financial independent sometime in your 30s.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work, Gonzalo!"
