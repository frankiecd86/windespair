message: "Very cool!\r\n\r\nHow are your other income streams going?\r\n\r\nI think I've seen you post some stuff on Medium under the partner program.\r\n\r\nI've been doing the partner program for about three months and this month is shaping up much better than the other two. It's probably going to finish ahead of my other online income streams such as YouTube and Amazon Associates. That will be the first time that has happened."
