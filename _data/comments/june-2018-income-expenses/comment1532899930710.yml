message: "Hey Gonzalo, I didn't see a button to reply to your comment directly so I'm just adding a new comment.\r\n\r\nYouTube has been pretty good for me, mostly from my initial bullet journal video which was over two years ago. It was a bit of a purposeful/accidental success. I realize that's a paradox, but I knew the video was going to be my most successful one, and I was intentional about how I positioned it (I noticed that not a lot of BuJo videos were done by men so I played that up), but I didn't realize how far that video would go. \r\n\r\nI've made about $1150 in my time on YouTube. I've shot a few videos that took a couple hours on a weekend and gone through a couple phases where I was uploading a short daily vlog from my phone.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that the money keeps rolling in, even when I'm not working on it. I think last month was close to $20 and This month with the new video it's probably going to be a little over $40.\r\n\r\nIt also is the biggest source of traffic for my Amazon Affiliate links. The better my videos do, the better Amazon does for me. The peak month for YouTube was over $100 and I think that Amazon was like $300 that month. I think it's like $30 this month.\r\n\r\nThe book is doing okay, although this has been a tough week. It made about $40 last month and could make something similar this month. But I'm counting on it continuing to sell and even selling better as I build influence online. \r\n\r\nMedium is going really well this month, It's at $126 pending the results from the final week, so I think I have a shot at $150. I'm going to go after the Medium partner program a little harder next month.\r\n\r\nAll this side income is pretty important for me since my income from my job isn't great and I'm supporting a family of four. I've stayed in good shape because of decent frugality, but as I think more about freeing myself from the rat race, building my side income is critical.\r\n\r\nYou should definitely take a crack at YouTube, it's another great opportunity to find an audience and to make a little money on the side. Plus you can use it to promote other things as well.\r\n\r\nIf you do get started on YouTube, I recommend doing stuff for Instagram's new IGTV as well. There's no direct way to monetize yet (other than promoting your own stuff in the description), but once there it, the people who built an audience early will be in good shape."
