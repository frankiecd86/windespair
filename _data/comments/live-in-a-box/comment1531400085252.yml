  i had a shared kitchen in westborough, mass once.  i would have minded less if
  the other residents weren't criminals and reprobates.  i'm no choirboy, but
  geez...  i had a one BR that was just fine but now we live in a giant house
  that mrs. me bought before i knew her.  that's just how it went but at least
  it was cheap.
