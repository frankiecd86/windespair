  100%. I feel fortunate that I came across bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and
  JL Collins in college. Being exposed to financial independence early helped me
  think in the "right way" about expenses and investing when I began my first
  full-time job last year. It's easier to incur as few of these harmful expenses
  (DirecTV, eating out every day, etc.) in the first place than to try to get
  rid of them later.
