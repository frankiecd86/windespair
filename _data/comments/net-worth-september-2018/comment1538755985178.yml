message: "Yup I'm working in Seattle! I'm really liking the Pacific Northwest. The winter in Seattle is tough since there's no sun and lots of rain (a constant, light rain), but the summer was great.\r\n\r\nI do plan on retiring sometime in the next 10 years if things go well. The Roth IRA is nice too since I can take out my contributions penalty free."
