message: "Good points, but there are three flaws in your argument:\r\n\r\n1.  There is no substitute for a good HS academic record; a great deal of financial aid is based on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores.  It's not just getting you admitted; it's getting you a better FA package.  And that INCLUDES your HS SR year.\r\n\r\n2.  Community Colleges offer many benefits, but when transferring to a 4-year school, the bigger schools tend to offer LESS financial aid to transfers than they do to incoming freshmen.  Rather obviously, they'd rather get 4 years tuition out of you than just 2, so FA for freshmen tends to be more plentiful.  Further, there can often be a challenge transferring credits, as the two institutions may not speak the same language (a good counselor at the CC level can help with this -- if you can find one).  Thus, someone intent on a 4-year degree should consider both options.\r\n\r\n3.  While agreeing with you that the price tag of a private school rarely justifies what it actually offers, private schools also offer far more financial aid than state schools.  So, again, they shouldn't be ruled out of consideration just on the base price.  Private schools also have \"inventory\" to fill, and will offer all kinds of FA to an attractive applicant (see good academic record, above).  As an aside, there can be intangible benefits to private schools -- does UPenn or Penn State look better on a resume?  What about alumni connections to potential job opportunities?"
