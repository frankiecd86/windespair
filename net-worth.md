### Why do I track my net worth?
1. **What gets measured, gets managed.**  

If there's a goal you want to reach (losing weight, saving money, meeting people) the best thing to do is to track it. You'll notice your habits and see if you're getting closer or further away from your goal.  

I want to be able to retire and not have to think about money at all.

1. **It's fun**

I treat this like a game. It's like when I played Lemonade Stand as a kid and became the world's greatest lemonade entrepreneur. It's fun to see this number go up. Plus, it helps calms my money anxieties.

### Why do I share my net worth?
The [current savings rate is just 3.4%!](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT) This is ridiculous. We don't talk about this enough.  

> You have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it. Create your own. Most people can't do it. **–– Mitch Schwartz**  

I've been lucky to find personal finance blogs, like [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com) and [jlcollinsnh](http://jlcollinsnh.com/), that have helped me solidify my thinking about money and I hope this site helps you.

Tracking your money is healthy and necessary.  

Hopefully this motivates you in some small way to start (or continue) tracking and increasing your net worth.

### How do I calculate my net worth?
Current value of: savings account + checking account + 401(k) + [VTSAX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&FundIntExt=INT&funds_disable_redirect=true) investments.

> Net Worth = Assets (savings, investments, property, etc) - Liabilities (debt, mortgage, etc)  

Different people calculate their net worth differently. Some people like to include the current value of their car, for example. I prefer to keep it simple.

The point is keep track of this number; calculate it however you want.

### How do I track this?
Once a month I input these 4 numbers (and a few others) on my "Net Worth" spreadsheet. Here's the template I use (link goes to Google Sheets) - [Gonzalo's fantastic net worth spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jkFRzfWAM7APFpkDXb_yKSZyCHRB11g7xA3gI-zINfI/edit?usp=sharing)
